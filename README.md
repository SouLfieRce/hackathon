# Smart Bus Management System

A comprehensive real-time bus optimization system built for Indian Tier-1 cities, developed for hackathon submission.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Urban bus systems in Indian cities like Bangalore, Delhi, and Pune rely on static timetables that fail to adapt to real-world conditions, leading to:
- Bus bunching (multiple buses arriving together)
- Under-utilized trips during off-peak hours  
- Unpredictable wait times for passengers
- Lack of real-time demand forecasting

## 🚀 Solution Overview

Our Smart Bus Management System provides:
